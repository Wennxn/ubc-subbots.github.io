description: Systems will need to be developed to navigate the craft, control camera movements, interact with objects, and fire torpedos at targets. We will develop and rapid prototype a robust, configurable frame to act as our system's test platform. By focusing on creating a simple yet reliable frame, we will expedite the process of integrating and testing electromechanical and electronic sub-systems.
